# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
- The project is to help Louise start her first Crowdfunding Campaign to help fund her play, "Fever". Her budget is estimated to be $10,000. In order to assist Louise, I must organize, sort, and analyze crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a projects campaign successful. I will use this excel data to set Louise up for a successful campaign by using other succesful campaigns within the same category to mirror Louise's campaign for "Fever".
    
### Purpose
- The purpose of this analysis is to assist Louise in starting her first Crowdfunding Campaign to help fund her play, "Fever".
    
## Analysis and Challenges
- To perform this analysis, I added additional columns and pivot charts and tables to the Kickstarter data sheet using the data collected from other campaigns. I determined the percentage funded and donation average for each campaign outlined in the data set. I created a pivot table and chart for Theatre Outcomes by Launch Date to analyze which campaigns were successful dependent on their start date. I created another pivot table and chart to analyze Outcomes vs. Goals. This was to determine the success of campaign based on what the goal percentage was.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- Challenges faced included determining the appropriate excel formulas in order to extract the data needed for each new data column. I used the tools learned throughout previous modules to determine the best equations to use.
    
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
There are two of many conclusions that could be drawn about the Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart. The first is that May is the most successful month to launch a campaign and so in order to have the best chance at succeeding, it is suggested to launch during the summertime. The second is that the month of December should be avoided as a launch date in order to have a succesful campaign due to the data showing the least amount of successful campaigns as well as the same or close to the same amount of campaigns that failed during this month. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The chart displaying Outcomes based on Goals indicated that the most successful play campaigns had a goal between the ranges of 45000 to 49999.
    
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There are a few limitations of this dataset. The first limitation of the dataset is the inability to understand the context of successful vs failed campaigns. The dataset does not include the details for why a campaign might've succeeded during a month that appears to return a low amount of successful campaigns. Therefor, conclusions could only be inferred that people prefer a month over another. Another limitation is the lack of explanation for the sudden drop in successful campaigns when the goal amount moves from 44999 to 45000 yet it seems to increase again after it is increased to 50000. The other limitation is we are unable to see plays that are succesful based on the pledged amount to goal amount. Could a play still be succesful if the goal isn't reached?
    
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could also create a table that shows Successful Campaigns based on Pledged Amount. This would display the amount used for the successful campaign and would give us a realistic idea of how much to plan for. We also know that Louise's budget is $10,000 so we could create a graph to display other plays with a budget of higher and lower than her budget and see if they were successful. Another graph that could be created is the length of the successful campaigns. We could create a graph that displays Outcomes based on Launched and End date to determine how long or how short the campaign needs to be to be the most successful.
